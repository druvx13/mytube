    <p class="mb-4">Welcome to MyTube, a project dedicated to recapturing the spirit and simplicity of the internet's golden age of video sharing. This application is a tribute to the YouTube of 2006, built to be simple, functional, and nostalgic.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Our goal is to provide a platform where the focus is purely on the content and the community, without the complex algorithms and cluttered interfaces of modern websites.</p>
    <p>This project was developed by <strong>DK</strong>.</p>
